<h1><a id = 'overview'> Overview</a></h1>

Skin cancer is among the most prevalent cancers globally, with melanoma being the most lethal form. Early detection is essential for effective treatment and improved survival rates. Traditionally, skin cancer diagnosis relies on visual examination by dermatologists, followed by biopsy and histopathological analysis. However, these methods can be time-consuming, subjective, and dependent on the clinician’s expertise. Recently, deep learning—a branch of artificial intelligence (AI)—has emerged as a promising tool that could enhance or even surpass these traditional diagnostic techniques.

Despite the potential of deep learning in skin cancer detection, emerging technologies such as 3D body imaging offer new opportunities to further advance this field. These technologies provide detailed data, including the location, shape, and color of lesions, as well as information about the surrounding skin. This wealth of information can be leveraged by machine learning algorithms to improve the accuracy and efficiency of cancer detection.

In this project, I develop two distinct approaches for skin cancer detection. The first approach utilizes computer vision models to analyze images of skin lesions. The second approach employs machine learning models to analyze a dataset comprising over 44 features related to skin lesions. By integrating these methods, I aim to enhance diagnostic accuracy and advance the capabilities of skin cancer detection.
