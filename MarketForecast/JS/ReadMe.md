<h1>Market forecast  Log</h1>


This project is about forecast the future market given time series data set consists of 79 features and 9 responses. The goal of this project is to predict one of the 9 responses. This depository consists of three ain sections:
1. section one consists of EDA, preprocessing, and feature engineering.
2. section two consists of machine lerning approach. Several methods, including ensemble tree-based moethods (RandomForest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Catboost) and linear model (regression) are employed to make prediction.
3. section three contains neural network approaches (MLP, encoder-decoder, and mbedding) are employed to preform the traiining and inference.

For both tracks (ML and DL), OOF KFold-cross-validation is employed to make prediction. Also several ensemble approaches are used to blend different methods into making stronger perdiction that could better generalize the prediction and be robust of noise.
