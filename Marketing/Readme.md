Areas:
- Data preprocessing, EDA, feature enginearing, and visualization

- Classification (logistic regression, random forest, SVM)


Datasets are from the following book:

Data Science for Marketing Analytics (2023) 
by Mirza Rahim Baig, Gururajan Govindan, Vishwesh Ravi Shrimali

__Note__: While some of the methods are similar to the ones that are suggested, I implement my own coding approach/style.
