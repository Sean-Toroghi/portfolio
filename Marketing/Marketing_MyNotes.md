# A/B testing for marketing
While A/B testing plays an important role across various induestries, it is a cruisial method in the marketing field. In the nutshell, it is a method for comparing and testing effectiveness and benefits of two different business strategies. In marketing, it helps to remove guesswork out of a decision-making, and save resouces/time, while increase performance of a policy or strategy. In this capacity, a typical A/B testing creates and tests two or more versions of marketing strategies for their effectiveness in achieving your marketing goal. A standard procedure is to randomly select/assign a sample of users in two groups. Then, for a predefined period of time, introduce service/product/bid to one group and collect predefined metrics from both groups. Once the tests are complete, we analyze and evaluate the experiment results. This requires checking whether there is a statistically significant difference between the results of the two versions.
