# A/B testing

In this depository, I provide some sample of running A/B test on variety of topics.

## 10 steps of running an A/B test
1. define a goal and form the hyp.
2. identify control and treatment groups
3. identify metrics
4. identy the needed data to be collected
5. determine the scale of desire difference to be detected
6. determine size of sample (power analysis) and length of the test
7. collect data (run the test)
8. run an A/A test (dummy test) to identify any systematic bias
