<h1>A comparative study of order forecasting models for a multi-channel retail company: a novel hybrid deep learning approach</h1>

# Introduction

The retail industry is a dynamic sector, where accurate forecasting of customer demand plays a crucial role in operational efficiency and financial performance. One of the key challenges faced by retail stores is the ability to predict sales and customer footfall accurately. Effective forecasting is vital for optimizing inventory levels, staffing, and supply chain operations, ultimately influencing customer satisfaction and profitability (Choi et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2018). Traditional methods, while foundational, often struggle to adapt to the complex patterns and trends observed in retail environments (Makridakis et al., 2018).

Time series forecasting has emerged as a critical tool for addressing these challenges. By leveraging historical sales data, time series models can provide insights into future customer demand, enabling retail stores to make informed decisions about stock replenishment and resource allocation (Hyndman & Athanasopoulos, 2018). Accurate forecasts can lead to more efficient inventory management, reduced stockouts, and better alignment between supply and demand (Kourentzes et al., 2014).

Recent advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence have significantly enhanced the capabilities of time series forecasting. Traditional methods, such as autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models, while foundational, often struggle with the non-linear and seasonal patterns inherent in e-commerce data (Box et al., 2015). In contrast, modern approaches, including deep learning techniques and ensemble methods, offer more sophisticated tools for capturing complex patterns and trends (Bengio et al., 2015; Liang et al., 2020).

This study, as a complement to existing survey studies on time series analysis (Wang et al., 2019), focuses on the application of advanced time series forecasting methods to predict sales and customer footfall in retail stores. By conducting a detailed analysis of various forecasting models, a comprehensive comparison between both classical and modern approaches, and across current model architectures leading the edge in deep learning forecasting filed is provided. This research utilizes a comprehensive dataset that includes historical sales records and customer traffic data from multiple retail locations, enabling a robust evaluation of model performance.

This study begins with reviewing the current landscape of time series forecasting techniques, highlighting their applicability and limitations within the retail context. Subsequently, the results of forecating for each model on real-world data reveals their effectiveness in generating accurate and actionable forecasts. Findings of this study provides valuable insights into the practical benefits of adopting advanced forecasting methods for retail stores, helping them enhance inventory management and operational efficiency (Xia et al., 2021).

In conclusion, the integration of sophisticated time series forecasting models represents a significant advancement for retail stores aiming to improve their sales and customer footfall predictions. By employing these modern techniques, retailers can achieve more precise forecasts, streamline their operations, and maintain a competitive edge in the ever-evolving retail landscape (Liu et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2023).
